This is the github of Artur
Allegedly I've been using this site for both professional and personal projects since 2013. Consequently, there is a lot of code here of very variable quality and relevance.

If you're interested in my professional achievements, you are better suited looking at my resume, or reading more about me on my website.

I am currently available for contract work - please reach out if you would benefit from my expertise!

If you're interested in the tools that a dinosaur like myself uses, then my dotfiles repo is likely of interest.

I no longer contribute to much open source in my free time, but I still have several projects.

Please feel free to contact me.
